The task was simply to create a database with three or more tables. That delt with multiple connections from one table to at least one other. In the example it was books on a specific shelf likely seperated by genre in a specific branch of a library. I wanted to create something I may use further in the course. A song inventory database that collects Title, Artist, genre, and status in my case: wish list, purchased or own but not on computer.

There are reasons why we're told that the curriculum is created for at your own pace learning but with guidance. It's in fact why I chose to do this. Going the university route would take to long, lose my patience and cost to much to do again. Online learning doesn't provide the structure I need, nor the claboration I desire. There are days that "I got this." Is muttered but more often now it's I understood it then but on my own it's a bunch of goblity gook.
