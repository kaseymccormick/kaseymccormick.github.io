The task was simply to create a database with three or more tables. That delt with multiple connections from one table to at least one other. In the example it was books on a specific shelf likely seperated by genre in a specific branch of a library. I wanted to create something I may use further in the course. A song inventory database that collects Title, Artist, genre, and status in my case: wish list, purchased or own but not on computer.

##I'm sinking but It's not sinking in##
There are reasons why we're told that the curriculum is created for at your own pace learning but with guidance. It's in fact why I chose to do this. Going the university route would take to long, lose my patience and cost to much to do again. Online learning doesn't provide the structure I need, nor the claboration I desire. There are days that "I got this." Is muttered but more often now it's I understood it then but on my own it's a bunch of goblity gook.
