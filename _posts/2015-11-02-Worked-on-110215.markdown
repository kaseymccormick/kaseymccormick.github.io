#A record of What I did on 110115#
Mainly because **I have _four_ jobs** and several Side Projects.
 
I have four jobs because they all pay within 5 dollars of what a big blue box retailer Cashier makes.

##At Internship
Hopscotch packaging files for dev team to implement.


##For Contract One
TODO Small changes to the website, logos and images. Checking on schedule for rest of the week.

##For Contract Two
This is new, trial period for the end of the year. Should start next week sometime. Front end development on Java/frameworker sites.

##Side Project One 
Parent teacher conference scheduler. Meeting this thursday about next steps/moving forward.


##Side Project Two
Availability overlap - on hold but using new language that i'm using at internship

##Side Project Three
Upcycled laundry hamper. The box is created, but it didn't turn out like I envisioned, it's higher then I thought due to wheels and needing to add hight to cover the pvc. May just turn it into a mobile work station for paper crafting.
