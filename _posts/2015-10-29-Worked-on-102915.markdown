#A record of What I did on 102715#
Mainly because **I have _four_ jobs** and several Side Projects.
 
I have four jobs because they all pay within 5 dollars of what a big blue box retailer Cashier makes.

##At Internship
Presented slidedecks of information to company had research for four different companies on each and recomendations of changes. I haven't done much coding in the last week mainly research and ux/ui concerns. Hopefully code tomorrow


##For Contract
The excell export has more changes needed. Have to parse out other columns for more information, or just do it by hand. 

_ask for best case senario (exactly what you desire) before doing work_ 


##Side Project One 
Parent teacher conference scheduler. Postponed first team meeting, but asked for review of current documents so i can address them earlier. TODO - all cards on table document: mainly explination how i see the project going and my intents of it.


##Side Project Two
Availability overlap - on hold but using new language that i'm using at internship

##Side Project Three
Upcycled laundry hamper. The box is created, but it didn't turn out like I envisioned, it's higher then I thought due to wheels and needing to add hight to cover the pvc. May just turn it into a mobile work station for paper crafting.
